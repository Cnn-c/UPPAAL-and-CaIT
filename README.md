# UPPAAL-and-CaIT
Transformation CaIT to UPPAAL
At first, we establish the relationship between timed automata and the CaIT calculus.
Using UPPAAL, we further verify six temporal properties of a ``smart home" example, including Boiler On Manually, Boiler Off Automatically, Boiler On Automatically, Lights On, Lights Mutually, and Windows Simultaneously.
This example mainly contains three parts, including lights, boiler, and windows.
Each part has been implemented and corresponds to one file of our project.
